# esp-serial-flasher

`esp-serial-flasher` is a portable C library for flashing or loading apps to RAM of Espressif SoCs from other host microcontrollers.

`esp-serial-flasher` supports a variety of host/target/interface combinations:

Supported **host** microcontrollers:

- STM32
- Raspberry Pi SBC
- ESP32 Series
- Any MCU running Zephyr OS
- Raspberry Pi Pico

Supported **target** microcontrollers:

- ESP32
- ESP8266
- ESP32-S2
- ESP32-S3
- ESP32-C3
- ESP32-C2
- ESP32-H2
- ESP32-C6
- ESP32-C5 (stub not included for now)

Supported hardware interfaces:

- UART
- USB CDC ACM
- SPI (only for RAM download)
- SDIO (only for RAM download, experimental)

For example usage check the [examples](/examples) directory.

You can also watch [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYqkOew8y8w) describing why and how to use the library, how it works and also how to implement a custom port.

## Configuration

These are the configuration toggles available to the user:

- `SERIAL_FLASHER_INTERFACE_UART`/`SERIAL_FLASHER_INTERFACE_SPI`/`SERIAL_FLASHER_INTERFACE_USB/SERIAL_FLASHER_INTERFACE_SDIO`

This defines the hardware interface to use.

Default: SERIAL_FLASHER_INTERFACE_UART

- `MD5_ENABLED`

If enabled, `esp-serial-flasher` is capable of verifying flash integrity after writing to flash.

Default: Enabled
> Warning: As ROM bootloader of the ESP8266 does not support MD5_CHECK, this option has to be disabled!

- `SERIAL_FLASHER_WRITE_BLOCK_RETRIES`

This configures the amount of retries for writing blocks either to target flash or RAM.

Default: 3

- `SERIAL_FLASHER_RESET_HOLD_TIME_MS`

This is the time for which the reset pin is asserted when doing a hard reset in milliseconds.

Default: 100

- `SERIAL_FLASHER_BOOT_HOLD_TIME_MS`

This is the time for which the boot pin is asserted when doing a hard reset in milliseconds.

Default: 50

- `SERIAL_FLASHER_RESET_INVERT`

This inverts the output of the reset gpio pin. Useful if the hardware has inverting connection
between the host and the target reset pin. Implemented only for UART interface.

Default: n

- `SERIAL_FLASHER_BOOT_INVERT`
This inverts the output of the boot (IO0) gpio pin. Useful if the hardware has inverting connection
between the host and the target boot pin. Implemented only for UART interface.

Default: n

Configuration can be passed to `cmake` via command line:

```bash
cmake -DMD5_ENABLED=1 .. && cmake --build .
```

### ESP Support

#### Supported ESP-IDF Versions

- v4.3 or later

### STM32 Support

> **Note:**: The library was tested with STM32CubeH7 v1.11.1 and arm-gnu-toolchain-13.2.

The STM32 port makes use of STM32 HAL libraries, and these do not come with CMake support. In order to compile the project, `stm32-cmake` (a `CMake` support package) has to be pulled as submodule.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-serial-flasher.git
```

If you have cloned this repository without the `--recursive` flag, you can initialize the submodule using the following command:

```bash
git submodule update --init
```

In addition to the configuration parameters mentioned above, the following definitions have to be set:

- STM32_TOOLCHAIN_PATH: path to arm toolchain (i.e /home/user/gcc-arm-none-eabi-9-2019-q4-major)
- STM32_CUBE_<CHIP_FAMILY>_PATH: path to STM32 Cube libraries (i.e /home/user/STM32Cube/Repository/STM32Cube_FW_F4_V1.25.0)
- STM32_CHIP: name of STM32 for which project should be compiled (i.e STM32F407VG)
- CORE_USED: core used on multicore devices (i.e. M7 or M4 on some STM32H7 chips)
- PORT: STM32

This can be achieved by passing definitions to the command line, such as:

```bash
cmake -DSTM32_TOOLCHAIN_PATH="path_to_toolchain" -DSTM32_CUBE_<CHIP_FAMILY>_PATH="path_to_cube_libraries" -DSTM32_CHIP="STM32F407VG" -DPORT="STM32" .. && cmake --build .
```

Alternatively, those variables can be set in the top level `cmake` directory:

```bash
set(STM32_TOOLCHAIN_PATH path_to_toolchain)
set(STM32_CUBE_H7_PATH path_to_cube_libraries)
set(STM32_CHIP STM32H743VI)
set(CORE_USED M7)
set(PORT STM32)
```

### Zephyr Support

> **Note:**: The library was tested with Zephyr RTOS v4.0.0 and Zephyr SDK v0.17.0.

The Zephyr port is ready to be integrated into Zephyr apps as a Zephyr module. In the manifest file (west.yml), add:

```yaml
    - name: esp-flasher
      url: https://github.com/espressif/esp-serial-flasher
      revision: master
      path: modules/lib/esp_flasher
```

And add

```yaml
CONFIG_ESP_SERIAL_FLASHER=y
CONFIG_CONSOLE_GETCHAR=y
CONFIG_SERIAL_FLASHER_MD5_ENABLED=y
```

to the project configuration `prj.conf`.

For the C/C++ source code, the example code provided in `examples/zephyr_example` can be used as a starting point.

### Raspberry Pi Pico Support

> **Note:** The library was tested with Raspberry Pi Pico SDK v1.5.1 and arm-gnu-toolchain-13.2.

The Raspberry Pi Pico port allows using the RP2040 microcontroller as a host for programming ESP devices.
For example usage, check the `examples/pi_pico_example` directory.

### Raspberry Pi Support

> **Note:**: The library was tested with the latest Raspberry Pi OS.

The Raspberry Pi port allows using the Raspberry Pi SBC as a host for programming ESP devices.
This port uses the pigpio library for GPIO control.
For example usage, check the `examples/raspberry_example` directory.

## Supporting a New Host Target

The port layer for the given host microcontroller can be implemented if not available, in order to support a new target, following functions have to be implemented by user:

- `loader_port_read()`
- `loader_port_write()`
- `loader_port_enter_bootloader()`
- `loader_port_delay_ms()`
- `loader_port_start_timer()`
- `loader_port_remaining_time()`

For the SPI interface ports

- `loader_port_spi_set_cs()`
needs to be implemented as well,

and

- `loader_port_sdio_card_init()`
for the SDIO interface ports.

The following functions are part of the [io.h](include/io.h) header for convenience, however, the user does not have to strictly follow function signatures, as there are not called directly from library.

- `loader_port_change_transmission_rate()`
- `loader_port_reset_target()`
- `loader_port_debug_print()`

Prototypes of all functions mentioned above can be found in [io.h](include/io.h).

After that, the target implementing these functions should be linked with the `flasher` target and the `PORT` CMake variable should be set to `USER_DEFINED`.
