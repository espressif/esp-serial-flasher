ESP Serial Flasher is a portable C library for programming and interacting with Espressif SoCs from other host microcontrollers.

## Overview

This library enables you to program Espressif SoCs from various host platforms using different communication interfaces. It provides a unified API that abstracts the underlying communication protocol, making it easy to integrate ESP device programming into your projects. In this context, the host (flashing/programming device running this library) controls the target (the ESP-series SoC being programmed). It serves a similar purpose to [esptool](https://github.com/espressif/esptool), but is designed for embedded hosts without a PC or Python runtime or on less powerful single board computers.

- **Connection and identification**: Connect to targets, autodetect chip family, read MAC address, retrieve security info.
- **Flash operations**: Write, read, erase, detect flash size, and verify data integrity via MD5.
- **RAM download and execution**: Load binaries to RAM and run them.
- **Registers and control**: Read/write registers, change transmission rate, reset the target.

### Supported Communication Interfaces

- **UART** - Universal asynchronous communication
- **USB CDC ACM** - USB virtual serial port
- **SPI** - Serial Peripheral Interface (RAM download only)
- **SDIO** - Secure Digital Input/Output (experimental)

> [!NOTE]
> SDIO interface is experimental and currently supports only ESP32-C5 and ESP32-C6 as target. The implementation uses a custom stub that will be made available as part of the migration to [esp-flasher-stub](https://github.com/espressif/esp-flasher-stub).

### Supported Host Platforms (device running this library and performing flashing)

- **STM32** microcontrollers
- **Raspberry Pi** SBC
- **ESP32 series** microcontrollers
- **Zephyr OS** compatible devices
- **Raspberry Pi Pico** (RP2040)

### Public API

- Public headers: [include/esp_loader.h](include/esp_loader.h), [include/esp_loader_io.h](include/esp_loader_io.h), and [include/esp_loader_error.h](include/esp_loader_error.h) define the stable public API of this library.
- Examples and helpers: [examples/common/](examples/common/) contains helper utilities used by the examples; not part of the library API, but can be used as a reference.

### Versioning and Compatibility

This library follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). The public API defined in `include/` folder maintains backward compatibility within the same major version — no breaking changes are introduced in minor or patch releases.

Port implementations (under `port/`) are reference implementations that depend on the SDK of the target platform. They are tested against the specific SDK versions listed in the [Platform Setup Guide](docs/platform-setup.md) and do not carry their own semver guarantee. Ports are maintained on a best-effort basis — breaking changes to them are minimized, but are sometimes necessary to stay up to date with upstream platform SDKs. When such an update is needed, it is released as a minor or patch version of this library.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Upgrading from v1?** v2 introduces breaking changes to the public API and the port layer. See the [Migration Guide](docs/migration-v1-to-v2.md) for a complete list of changes and step-by-step upgrade instructions.

### Basic Usage

```c
#include "esp_loader.h"
#include "esp32_port.h"  // replace with the port header for your platform

esp_loader_error_t err;

// 1. Fill in the port struct with hardware parameters
esp32_port_t port = {
    .port.ops          = &esp32_uart_ops,
    .baud_rate         = 115200,
    .uart_port         = UART_NUM_1,
    .uart_rx_pin       = GPIO_NUM_5,
    .uart_tx_pin       = GPIO_NUM_4,
    .reset_trigger_pin = GPIO_NUM_25,
    .gpio0_trigger_pin = GPIO_NUM_26,
};

// 2. Initialize the loader context — binds the protocol and port vtable
esp_loader_t loader;
err = esp_loader_init_uart(&loader, &port.port);
if (err != ESP_LOADER_SUCCESS) return err;

// 3. Connect to the target chip
esp_loader_connect_args_t connect_args = ESP_LOADER_CONNECT_DEFAULT();
err = esp_loader_connect(&loader, &connect_args);
if (err != ESP_LOADER_SUCCESS) return err;

// 4. Flash a binary (example: 64KB at 0x10000)
// Variable holding your binary image. Typical sources:
// - Read from storage (SD card, filesystem, flash)
// - Received over a link (UART/SPI/USB/Wi-Fi) into a RAM buffer
// - Compiled-in C array generated from a .bin
const uint8_t *data = /* pointer to your firmware image buffer */;

esp_loader_flash_cfg_t flash_cfg = {
    .offset     = 0x10000,
    .image_size = 65536,
    .block_size = 4096,
};
err = esp_loader_flash_start(&loader, &flash_cfg);
if (err != ESP_LOADER_SUCCESS) return err;

size_t offset = 0;
while (offset < flash_cfg.image_size) {
    size_t chunk = MIN(flash_cfg.block_size, flash_cfg.image_size - offset);
    err = esp_loader_flash_write(&loader, &flash_cfg, (void *)(data + offset), chunk);
    if (err != ESP_LOADER_SUCCESS) return err;
    offset += chunk;
}

err = esp_loader_flash_finish(&loader, &flash_cfg);
if (err != ESP_LOADER_SUCCESS) return err;
```

## Known Limitations

The following limitations are currently known:

- Binary image size must be known before flashing
- ESP8266 targets do not support the MD5 verify command; set `skip_verify = true` in `esp_loader_flash_cfg_t` for ESP8266 targets
- SPI interface only supports RAM download operations
- SDIO interface is experimental with limited platform support
- Only one target can be flashed at a time
